Marburg story

My hund is taking up all my funds.
He keeps eating all of the apfelkuchen I buy.
He goes especially crazy when I throw brots all over the floor.
After a trip to the biergarten, he gets sleepy.
He stumbled into Eltz castle to find a nice place to nap.
The baeckerei seems like a good place to nap.
So he found a nice spot and used a gebaeck as a pillow!
When he woke up, we both made our way home on the hauptstrasse.
It was so hot, we both couldn't wait to get home to the klimaanlage.
We feels much better now. Schloss sweet, schloss. 
After dozing off, we were awakened by security telling us this was not our schloss, but rather Eltz castle!
